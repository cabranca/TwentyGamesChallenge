# TwentyGamesChallenge

In this repo I've started the Twenty Games Challenge from https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/. I decided to implement the games in Godot and so far I've made both level 1 games (Flappy Bird and Pong). Breakout from level 2 is work in progress and my idea is to keep the art very simple and focus on the mechanics as this is what I want to learn the most.
